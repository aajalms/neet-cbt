    q: "A child presents with progressive visual loss. MRI brain shows fusiform enlargement of the optic nerve with T2 hyperintensity and mild enhancement. The most likely diagnosis is:",
    options: [
      "Optic neuritis",
      "Optic nerve sheath meningioma",
      "Optic pathway glioma",
      "Retinoblastoma"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    marks: 4,
    explanation: `
Optic pathway glioma is classically seen in children and is commonly associated with NF-1.
It is usually a pilocytic astrocytoma (WHO Grade I).
MRI shows fusiform enlargement of the optic nerve/chiasm with T2 hyperintensity.

Why others are wrong:
A. Optic neuritis → Acute, painful, inflammatory; no fusiform enlargement.
B. Optic nerve sheath meningioma → Tram-track sign with intense enhancement.
D. Retinoblastoma → Intraocular mass with calcification.

Memory tip:
NF-1 child + optic nerve = Glioma

    q: "Optic pathway glioma is most commonly associated with which genetic abnormality?",
    options: [
      "Chromosome 22 deletion",
      "Chromosome 17 mutation",
      "Chromosome 11 mutation",
      "Chromosome 9 deletion"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    marks: 4,
    explanation: `
NF-1 is caused by mutation of the NF1 gene on chromosome 17.
Loss of neurofibromin leads to increased RAS signaling and tumor formation.

Why others are wrong:
A. Chromosome 22 → NF-2 (bilateral acoustic neuromas).
C. Chromosome 11 → Wilms tumor.
D. Chromosome 9 → Basal cell nevus syndrome.

Mnemonic:
NF-1 = 1 & 7 (17)
NF-2 = 2 & 2 (22)

    q: "3D CT skull of a patient with NF-1 shows enlargement of orbit with absence of posterior wall. This imaging sign is called:",
    options: [
      "Harlequin eye sign",
      "Bare orbit sign",
      "Copper beaten skull",
      "Cloverleaf skull"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    marks: 4,
    explanation: `
Bare orbit sign is due to sphenoid wing dysplasia in NF-1.
The posterior orbital wall is absent, giving an empty orbit appearance on 3D CT.

Why others are wrong:
A. Harlequin eye sign → Coronal synostosis.
C. Copper beaten skull → Raised intracranial pressure.
D. Cloverleaf skull → Craniosynostosis syndromes.

Memory tip:
NF-1 eats the sphenoid → orbit becomes bare

    q: "Which of the following skeletal abnormalities is NOT typically associated with Neurofibromatosis type 1?",
    options: [
      "Ribbon ribs",
      "Scoliosis",
      "Posterior vertebral scalloping",
      "Ivory vertebra"
    ],
    correct: 3,
    marks: 4,
    explanation: `
Common skeletal features of NF-1 include:
Ribbon ribs, scoliosis, posterior vertebral scalloping, and sphenoid dysplasia.

Why others are wrong:
A, B, C → Classic NF-1 findings.
D. Ivory vertebra → Seen in Paget disease or metastasis, not NF-1.

Mnemonic:
NF-1 Skeleton = R S S S
Ribbon ribs – Scoliosis – Scalloping – Sphenoid dysplasia

    q: "Multiple café-au-lait macules are seen in a patient. What is the minimum number and size (post-puberty) required to diagnose NF-1?",
    options: [
      "≥3 spots, >5 mm",
      "≥6 spots, >5 mm",
      "≥6 spots, >15 mm",
      "≥5 spots, >10 mm"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    marks: 4,
    explanation: `
Diagnostic criteria for NF-1:
At least 6 café-au-lait macules.
Size >5 mm in children and >15 mm in adults.

Why others are wrong:
Incorrect number or size.

Mnemonic:
NF-1 drinks coffee SIX times in BIG cups
